This directory contains the original images generated by Midjourney, the original prompt given can be seen in the file names.

These prompts are a starting point which is mutated by chosing variations, as such the image may not represent the prompt in the file name.

Midjourney does not really understand what the prompt means, but it reflects the training data it was given that matches the prompt. Errors are absolutely present in Midjourney's training data.

Sometimes I had an intent for a prompt, but ended up down a different path after seeing the results. No offense is intended by any categorisation here.
