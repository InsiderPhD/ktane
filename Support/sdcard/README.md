This directory contains the assets needed by KTANE, these assets are extracted
from the game and reencoded for use here.

Members of the KTANE community have enquired with KTANE about the legality of using
assets from the game, their opinion was summed up as follows:

* If you're building one and playing it, you need to have a copy of the game. The physical one is just "the way you are playing" your copy.
* If you want to charge for playing it, you need to have a purchased copy of the game for every instance, and pay the royalty fee as if it was just a digital copy of the game.

Thus the assets are included here for use, but you must abide by their rules and licensing conditions.
